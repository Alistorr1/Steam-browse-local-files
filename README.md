# Steam-browse-local-files
I am using my Chromebook to use steam to play Stardew Valley, however, I was hoping to use Linux to program in SMAPI for mods, and I have almost completed the steps to download SMAPI through Linux, but Iâ€™m at the final step that is asking for the file location and when checking Steam, where I have the game on, browse local files button fails.
